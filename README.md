# Open Cloud Computing Incident Response Framework (OCCIRF)
The *Open Cloud Computing Incident Response Framework (OCCIRF)* is an open-source framework to help you prepare for
incidents in a cloud environment. This framework not written for a specific cloud. It supports all cloud solutions and
is a more generic framework.  
This framework is more focused on the process of the incident response. In the [examples](examples) folder you can find
some examples how to implement given tasks in the cloud. The framework is divided in four main parts:

1. [Preparation](preparation)
1. [Organizational preparation](preparation/organisational.md)
2. [Technical preparation](preparation/technical.md)
2. [Handling](handling)
3. [Post-processing](post)

As nowadays more organizations are not only cloud service customers but also cloud service providers the framework is
dividing the process at some places in those two parts if there are differences.

This process framework is not a complete framework for all the needed processes. The scope is only the cloud incident
response. It is always recommended following ITIL as an IT process management framework. In ITIL following processes are
a good start to complete this process:
- Asset and Configuration Management
- Change management
- Incident Management
- Security Management

## Quick Start
As most of us don't want to read the documentation we developed a quick start checklist to immediately start working on
the process. The checklist does not fully replace the full documentation, but it is a quick way to start working on the
process.

## Description
Corporations are shifting their IT infrastructure to the cloud.
With the usage of the cloud new security risks are present.
Those risks can lead to incidents, which need to be addressed.
Classic on-premises incident response frameworks might not work in the cloud.
Furthermore, the cloud service providers offer different cloud solutions where different response actions have to be taken.
To answer these issues an incident response framework was designed to close the gap for incident response in the cloud.
This framework focuses the process as the technology differs too much between the different cloud providers for a general incident response framework.
The resulting framework is an open-source process framework for incident response in the cloud with templates and examples how to handle incidents properly.
