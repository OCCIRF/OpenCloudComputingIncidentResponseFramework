# Open Cloud Computing Incident Response Framework (OCCIRF)
The *Open Cloud Computing Incident Response Framework (OCCIRF)* is an open source framework to help you prepare for
incidents in a cloud environment. This framework not written for a specific cloud. It supports all cloud solutions and
is a more generic framework.  
This framework is more focused on the process of the incident response. In the [examples](examples) folder you can find 
some examples how to implement given tasks in the cloud. The framework is divided in three main parts:
1. [Preparation](preparation)
2. Handling
3. Post-processing

As nowadays more organisations are not only cloud service customers but also cloud service providers the framework is 
dividing the process at some places in those two parts if there are differences.
