# Handling an Incident
Handling an incident in the cloud is the most different part for the incident response process compared to the
on-premises world. The reason for this is, that the responsibility for the systems is shared between the cloud service
provider and the cloud service customer. Infrastructure-as-a-service it is still comparable to the on-premises process.
Incident response for Platform-as-a-service is more restricted and different. The software-as-a-service model has the
lest possibilities for the customers to conduct incident response. Most of the time it is impossible to investigate the
incident as a customer.  
For the handling of the incident response a [template](../templates/incidentFactsSheet.md) is available to document the
incident.
