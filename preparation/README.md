# Incident preparation
The preparation is an integral part of the incident response process. Here you need to plan and prepare your strategy
and your tools. 
## Asset management
To properly react to an incident in the own environment an asset management needs to be established. The asset
management contains all relevant assets which might be helpful in an incident case. Those assets are (not all):
- Accounts or Subscriptions (Public Cloud/SaaS)
- Running services
  - IP addresses
  - Servers / components (like databases, application server services)
  - Service owners
  - Criticality
  - Processed data
- ***@TODO: More needed***

Those fact sheets can be stored in an asset management tool or a simple database (See [examples/assetManagement](../examples/assetManagement.md)). 
Also, an offline version is possible as in an incident case it is not guaranteed that the online asset management tools
are accessible (See [templates/assetFactsSheet](../templates/assetFactsSheet.md)).  
The more precisely the facts sheets are the easier it is to get all needed assets in an incident case. To assure that
all facts sheets are up to date a periodic review should be done.
   
## Roles and responsibilities
Defined responsibilities are important in an incident process as all involved persons need to know what they need to do.

### As provider

### As customer

## Access concept
The access concept for incident response is an interesting topic. Here it is important to guarantee quick reaction times
but also honor the least privileges principle. 

## Communication

## Governance
