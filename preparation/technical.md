## Log preparation
An important part of the technical preparation is to prepare the logging process. The log entries are one of the most
important source of information about the health of a system and a great indicator of a possible compromise or other
incident. Log files are there to trace certain events through an application and whole environments. Therefor log files
need to be central aggregated and configured to have e.g. the same time source and time zone.  
Further more log entries needs to be protected from manipulation or deletion from unauthorized parties.
